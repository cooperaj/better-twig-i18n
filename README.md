Better Twig i18n
======

Allows the use of a POT/PO/MO (gettext) set of language definitions with Twig, using an identical syntax to the current
official [Twig translation extension](https://github.com/symfony/twig-bridge).

It supports full extraction of Twig templates into language catalogues from the 
[gettext/gettext](https://github.com/php-gettext/Gettext) library, which you can use to write out POT files if desired.
 
 ## Usage
 
 > See [extract.php](example/extract.php) and [index.php](example/index.php) for example usage.
